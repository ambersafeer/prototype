		<h1 class="page-title"> The Search for Art in New Brunswick</h1>
		<h2> The world is teeming with art at every waking moment, but the question is: are you looking hard enough to find it?</h2>
		<p> Evidently, there is art all around us, from the booming architecture found in industrial cities to Mother Nature's own delicate creations. At Creative Café, we want to emphasize art's universal disposition by sharing our favorite pieces in our city. Not only do we hope to shed light and acknowledgement to these often-forgotten pieces, but we also intend to help <em>you</em> open up your artist eye to what's possible.</p>
		
		<p>Join us as we discover art (the good, the bad, and the unconventional) all throughout New Brunswick, NJ! If you're feeling awfully inspired by our gallery, be sure to share your own with the hashtag #Search4Art and tag us on Instagram @creative.café.nb!</p>
		
		
		<h3>Social Justice</h3>
		<p>This section is dedicated to art with a deeper purpose in addition to its beauty. Coincidentally (or not), these are all murals, perhaps because the message is easier to spread when displayed to a wider audience. The first, referred to both as "The Dreams of Our Children" and "Una Gota Rompe La Piedra" (A Drop Breaks the Stone) is a mural located on the building at the intersection of Jersey Avenue and French Street in New Brunswick, NJ. In celebration of Oxacan Mexican culture, a population that is very prominent in New Brunswick, the mural features a vibrant depicition of a Latino family, complete with vivid colors and a hopeful message for the future of the community's children.</p>
		
		<p>
		Next up is the mural representing the School of Social work, a piece spelling out "Toward a More Just Future" in both English and American Sign Language. The panels found all across the building send a message of love and acceptance through its image referencing empowerment for the LGBTQ+ community, women, the Black Lives Matter movement, and much more.</p>
		
		<p>Finally, we have "Convergence Point," a mural created by Rutgers Mason Gross School of the Arts alum Ingrid Morales. This piece, located in Deiner Park (behind the river dorms) is a 100-foot wide mural depicting the university history and American history, meeting in the center to where they overlap. The art piece is meant to demonstrate how Rutgers University encourages and supports its students to become global leaders of the future.</p>

		<h3>More than Meets the Eye</h3>
		<p>As we scuttle across campus with our heads held down, we tend to miss the art that is <em> right</em> in front of us. Perhaps it's the statue we ignore because we see it on a day to day or maybe some window panels we overlook because we refuse to look up for once. And yet, despite how often we neglect them, they hold such history and deep meaning.</p>
		
		<p> For example, take "A World Turned Inside Out," a World War II Memorial honoring the 7,618 woman and men of Rutgers University that served. While some may see it as just some slabs of stone, this intricate plaza of sculpture and granite borders reveal a deep history of our university and celebrate the brave alumni who took part in it. During the spring, the surrounding cherry blossoms also send a message of the beauty in life and death, the idea that mortality is a gift to be used wisely.</p>
		
		<p> Following this is the Class of 1957 Stained Glass Window featured on the South building of the Honors College. As a gift for the 60th year reunion of the aforementioned class, this piece symbolizes the combining of the university's history with its future. On the left lies the Rutgers Coat of Arms, established in 1966, juxtaposed with the right's new 2015 shield. Both are an incredibly important part of the university's (and city's) history, so to have them side by side shows the progression in a very elegant way.</p>
		
		<p>Lastly is the "Walking Man" by New Jersey artist George Segal, located in front of the Zimmerli Art Museum</p>Next time you're walking to class, keep an eye out. Maybe you'll find unexpected treasure!</p>
