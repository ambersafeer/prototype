				<p>Welcome to the Creative Café, a resourceful website for broke art students, based in New Brunswick, NJ! Our aim is to provide you with a thriving community of like-minded artists as you explore our many helpful reviews, inspirational art showcases, related readings/blogs, and more. As a group of college-aged artists, our team understands the difficulties of experiencing artist block, making time to create, and finding budget-friendly art supplies. That's why here at the Creative Café, we provide countless resources to combat these issues so that you can continue on your artist journey. </p>

				<p> Continue down to view some of the beautiful artworks here in New Brunswick, or click around to explore what else is on the menu at our cyber-café. Stay tuned to see what we brew up next!</p>
